<p>Declarative enhancement for HTML: simple, composable, lean. It's main goal is to
  eliminate most of the logic from JS, while allowing to make a good interactive

        It's only a handful core attributes (like <code>ts-req</code>,
        <code>ts-action</code>, <code>ts-trigger</code>) and strives to avoid
        surprises. Also there are no dependencies on your server-side
        technology, you can use <b>anything</b>.

## What it is

TwinSpark could be mentally split in three parts:

- [Page fragment updates](api/ts-req/) facilitated via HTML attributes
  (no JS needed). This is the core idea.
- [Morphing](api/ts-swap/#morph) - a strategy to update HTML graduallly,
  without breaking state and focus. Makes form validation and animations on HTML
  changes a breeze.
- [Actions](api/ts-action/) - incredibly simple promise-enabled language for
  (limited) client-side scripting. Bring your logic into a single place.

Some reasons why TwinSpark exists despite [HTMx](https://htmx.org/) and
[Unpoly](https://unpoly.com/) (those are similar in approach):

- It's really small (8KB `.min.gz`).
- There is no attribute inheritance â€” this is a big one, it keeps surprises away.
- [Batching](api/ts-req-batch/) - very useful if you want to use HTTP
  caching effectively, while maintaining some personalisation for your
  users.
- Bundling - a lot of practical stuff packed in, like triggering an event when
  [element is almost visible](api/ts-trigger/), or
  [handling clicks outside](api/ts-trigger/#outside) the element.
- Extensibility - you can easily register new directives the same way those in
  core are registered.
